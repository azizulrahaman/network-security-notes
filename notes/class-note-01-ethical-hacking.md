# Class Note 01 – Ethical Hacking Overview

## 1. Definition of Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking is the authorized practice of identifying vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications to improve security posture.

Unlike malicious hacking, ethical hacking operates under:
- Legal authorization
- Defined scope
- Professional ethics

---

## 2. Goals of Ethical Hacking

- Identify security weaknesses
- Simulate real-world attacks
- Strengthen defensive controls
- Reduce organizational risk
- Support compliance requirements

---

## 3. Types of Hackers

### White Hat
Security professionals who operate with authorization.

### Black Hat
Malicious attackers exploiting vulnerabilities for personal gain.

### Gray Hat
Operate between ethical and unethical boundaries.

## 4. Ethical Hacking Methodology

1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
2. Scanning
3. Enumeration
4. Gaining Access
5. Maintaining Access
6. Covering Tracks

This structured approach mirrors real-world penetration testing frameworks.
